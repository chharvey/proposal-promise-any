# ECMAScript proposal: `Promise.any`

## Status

This proposal is at stage 0 of [the TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).

## Motivation

There are four main combinators in the `Promise` landscape.

| name                 | fulfillment value                     | rejection reason                             | short-circuits             | spec                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise.allSettled` | array of all settled inputs           | (does not reject)                            | (does not short-circuit)   | [separate proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-allSettled) ðŸ”œ |
| `Promise.race`       | first settled input, if it fulfilled  | first settled input, if it rejected          | when an input is settled   | added in ES2015 âœ…                                                           |
| `Promise.all`        | array of all inputs, if all fulfilled | reason of first rejected input               | when an input is rejected  | added in ES2015 âœ…                                                           |
| `Promise.any`        | first fulfilled input                 | array of all reasons, if all inputs rejected | when an input is fulfilled | this proposal ðŸ†•                                                             |

These are all commonly available in userland promise libraries, and theyâ€™re all independently useful, each one serving different use cases.

## Proposed solution

`Promise.any` accepts an array of promises and returns a promise that is fulfilled by the first given promise to be fulfilled, or rejected with an array of rejection reasons if all of the given promises are rejected.

## High-level API

```js
try {
  const first = await Promise.any(promises);
  // Any of the promises was fulfilled.
} catch (reasons) {
  // All of the promises were rejected.
}
```

Or, without `async`/`await`:

```js
Promise.any(promises).then(
  (first) => {
    // Any of the promises was fulfilled.
  },
  (reasons) => {
    // All of the promises were rejected.
    // `reasons` is an array containing the rejection reasons.
  }
);
```

### FAQ

#### Why choose the name `any`?

It clearly describes what it does, and thereâ€™s precedent for the name `any` in userland libraries offering this functionality:
